# Raw Data Directory

Place unmodified source datasets here (e.g., CSVs downloaded from FRED or other open data portals).
Guidelines:
- Keep files read-only after download to preserve provenance.
- Document the source URL, access date, and any credentials used (if applicable) in a companion README or notebook cell.
- Prefer original file names from the provider; add a short prefix if multiple versions exist (e.g., `fred_cpi_2024-01.csv`).

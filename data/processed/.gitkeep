# Processed Data Directory

Use this folder for cleaned or engineered datasets generated from notebooks or scripts.
Guidelines:
- Write outputs with descriptive names that indicate the transformation (e.g., `cpi_features.parquet`, `market_returns_daily.csv`).
- Store derived artifacts like summary tables, merged panels, or model-ready features here.
- Record the upstream raw file(s), processing date, and key steps in notebook markdown or a small metadata file alongside the output.

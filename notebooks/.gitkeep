# Notebooks Directory

Store exploratory data analysis notebooks here. Example workflow:
1. Create a new notebook (e.g., `finance_overview.ipynb`).
2. Import helpers from `src/eda_template.py` to load and visualize FRED series.
3. Save generated charts to `../figures` to keep outputs under version control.

Keep dataset-specific notes in the notebook metadata or in markdown cells to document your analytical steps.

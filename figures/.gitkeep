# Figures Directory

Use this folder to store charts and plots generated during analysis.
Recommended conventions:
- Export static images (PNG/SVG) from notebooks or scripts.
- Prefix filenames with the dataset or topic (e.g., `gdp_growth_trend.png`).
- Include the date in filenames when relevant to track data vintages.

Generated figures can be referenced in reports or shared summaries.
